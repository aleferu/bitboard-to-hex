# Bitboard to hexadecimal converter

Fast project I developed in order to help me build [mini-a-b](https://github.com/aleferu/mini-a-b "mini-a-b"), a chess engine project.


## Usage

Example use:

```console
$ python3 bitboard-to-hex.py pieces/*
```

## File format

To understand the needed file format check the `pieces` folder. Just 0s and 1s representing a chess board.
